A super bold brush font with a notable painterly feel. Characterised by heavy, textured brush strokes. This brush is as natural as it gets. I have done very little editing  in order to maintain the dry brush style and emphasise the hand painted aesthetic. Itâ€™s application is perfect for use in displays, branding projects, logos, signage, posters, invites and more.

### Includes:

- OTF, TTF & WOFF formats.
- One Font Weight.
- English Language only.
- Upper & Lowercase.
- Punctuation, numerals and symbols.
