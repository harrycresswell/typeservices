Who doesn’t like free fonts?!

All Type Services fonts are currently available for free.

To get hold of any font for free visit the Fonts page and hit the download link. To start the download, enter ‘0’ and hit ‘I want this!’ in the form. Please read the [licensing information](/licensing/) if you’re unsure how you can use your new font.

### One Tree Planted

For every donation of £2 or more, £1 of your donation will go towards the [OneTreePlanted.org](https://onetreeplanted.org/) reforestation program, where one tree is planted for every £1 donated. Donations are completely optional, you are still very welcome to download fonts for free.
