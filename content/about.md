Type Services is the type design practice of [Harry Cresswell](https://harrycresswell.com/). Currently the project explores texture and imperfection in hand drawn typography.

### Credits

This site is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the Go based static site generator. The site is hosted directly from a [GitHub repository](/) and served on the JAMstack by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

Type is currently set using [system defaults](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/system-font-stack/), meaning it will render differently depending on your operating system. I’m using [a fluid type mixin](https://www.madebymike.com.au/writing/fluid-type-calc-examples/) developed by Mike Riethmuller to make type responsive for different screen resolutions. Sizing is set using 2 modular scales, [5:6 — minor third](http://www.modularscale.com/?1&em&1.2) for smaller devices and [3:5 — major sixth](http://www.modularscale.com/?1&em&1.667) for desktop. Resize your browser to see it in action.

All images on the site are hosted with [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) which handles automatic responsiveness, where different images are serverd depending on the device.

If you have any questions you can [reach me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/harrycresswell), I’d be happy to help.
